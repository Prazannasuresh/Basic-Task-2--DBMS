A simple database can be created using MySQL.
First of all, we create a database. In the query, we can execute this; while executing the queries for the second time, there will be an error arising, denoting that the database is already existing. To get rid of this error, we can use the query *drop database database_name*, so that we can again execute the first creating query succesfully.
We can execute the queries either one by one, or altogether.
Last query is to delete an entry; thus, it is advisable to execute them query-by-query, so that all the processes happens step by step.
